Project Summary:
In the Spring term of 2024, for the GR5243 Applied Data Science course, our team developed an Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization Shiny app focused on disaster assistance in the United States. This project utilized OpenFEMA datasets, enhanced with geographic coordinates through Google's Geocoding API, to analyze and visualize the distribution and efficiency of FEMA assistance to homeowners and renters affected by disasters. Our app provides insights into the efficiency of disaster support across various regions, aiming to highlight areas where FEMA's assistance has been most effective and identify those that require further attention and resources.

Learning Goals Achieved:
Business Intelligence for Data Science: Leveraged FEMA data to generate actionable insights for improving disaster response and support allocation.
Data Cleaning: Conducted extensive data cleaning and merging to prepare datasets for analysis.
Data Visualization: Utilized Shiny, ggplot2, and Plotly for dynamic and static visualizations of disaster support data.
Systems Development/Design Life Cycle: Followed a systematic approach to design, develop, and deploy the Shiny app.
Shiny App/Shiny Server: Developed a comprehensive Shiny app to facilitate user interaction with FEMA disaster assistance data.

Contribution Statement:
This project was solely developed by Zichen Zhao, encompassing all stages from initial data preparation to the final development and deployment of the Disaster Assistance Dashboard. My work involved extensive data cleaning, merging, and analysis, as well as the application of various data visualization techniques using Shiny, ggplot2, and Plotly to present the data in an interactive and informative manner. The development process required a deep dive into the OpenFEMA datasets, enhancing them with geographic coordinates through Google's Geocoding API, and crafting a user-friendly application that provides valuable insights into FEMA's disaster assistance efforts. The dashboard stands as a testament to my dedication to leveraging data science for societal benefit, and I am proud to present it in this GitHub repository.
